            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="text">This is basically a Library System and this Library System (LS) acts as a tool to transform
                traditional libraries into digital libraries. The primary objective of any library system is to
                collect, store, organize, retrieve and make available the information sources to the
                information users. A library, as a system, is a subsystem of some super-system (An
                organization in any field, whether education, research or social service).
                Furthermore, in our Library System, we are facilitating to provide services such as
                Novels, Short Stories, Documentations, O/L and A/L, to those who seek knowledge,
                wisdom and freedom. Like other Library System (LS), we are not categorized, separable
                or focused only a one group of people/users. Our Library System (LS) is free to use
                anyone who need. The most important thing is users are not required to pay money to
                get this facility and this is totally free.</p>
